![Lab trip at kita karuizawa](/lab_trip.jpg)

I have a good collection of things I am interested or excited about (Science, Human Psychology, History, Science Fiction, art, poetry, music, food and most importantly the uncertainty and oddness in our Universe. And my love to have endless conversations about all of this. What makes me even more excited is the combination of all of these things. It is often good and a relief that you might not be the only one thinking in a particular way.  So just to have a platform where people with similar interests can come and engage. More the merrier.
